When a favorable arbitrage opportunity is identified, the bot automatically executes the trades to capitalize on the price disparity and generate profits.Through continuous monitoring of various DEX platforms, bot analyzes real-time market data to identify instances where an asset's price diverges significantly across exchanges.
