# dex-arbitrage-bot
The bot continuously monitors the prices of specific assets on different DEXs, looking for opportunities to buy at a lower price on one exchange and sell at a higher price on another. When a favorable arbitrage opportunity is identified, the bot automatically executes the trades to capitalize on the price disparity and generate profits.
